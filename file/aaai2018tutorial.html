								The problem of Fake News is arguably one of the most serious challenges facing the media industry and a threat to democratic societies worldwide. By exploiting the current infrastructure of social media platforms where contents can be created and disseminated to a large audience with a little to zero cost, and the click-through-rate based revenue model of the media ecosystem, the problem has reached to an unprecedented level. To mitigate such fake news spread, researchers from multiple disciplines have proposed various strategies, envisioned automated and semi-automated checking systems and recommended policy changes across the media ecosystem. In this tutorial, we analyze the current state of the Fake News problem, its variations, and summarize the recent research findings on this emerging and timely topic. Specifically, we focus on the efforts from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Database (DB) communities to detect fake news and curb its spread and show their strengths and limitations. Finally, we present a set of research questions and suggest how they can be tackled using the combination of both AI and DB approaches.

<!--								We currently witness an unprecedented proliferation of "fake news"â€”i.e., false stories todeceive or mislead people. As many recent examples clearly demonstrate (e.g., pizzagateconspiracy incident in 2016), not only fake news stories are problematic themselves asnews, severely undermining the credibility of online journalism, but also they could havereal-world consequences, resulting in violence or influencing election results. As such, itbecomes increasingly important for policy makers to regulate and discourage thecreation of fake news, for online businesses to prevent and detect fake news better, andfor citizens to protect themselves from fake news.-->
<!--								</br></br>-->
<!--								Despite such needs and the urgency of the problem, however, our understanding of fakenews is in general insufficient. We do not clearly understand why/how people create fakenews, who produce and publish them, how fake news spreads, what characteristicsdistinguish fake news from legitimate ones, or why some people fall for fake news (andothers do not). Better understanding of fake news will have important benefits to society,by allowing us to come up with algorithmic solutions for detecting fake news andstemming them before they are widely disseminated. This will help restore the credibilityof online information and help people better handle fake news in the future. With therising interest in the topic and its obvious societal implications, we believe that our research project is ideally positioned to make intellectual contributions with broaderimpacts on society.-->
